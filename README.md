# comlib
A multi-platform message-passing library for distributed architecture robots.  
The goal is to build from scratch all the software needed to turn an Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit into a fully autonomous robot.
Comlib is the ROS-inspired message passing layer on top of which all the distributed robot architecture will be built.

### Why don't use ROS?
The point here is not delivering a product but just having fun and learning something along the way.
